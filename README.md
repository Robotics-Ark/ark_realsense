# Intel RealSense Package

This repository provides a simple integration of the Intel RealSense camera with the Ark robotics framework.

## Installation

1. Install the package in editable mode so that the examples can find the module:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

This will also install the minimal Python dependencies listed in `setup.py`.

## Examples

The `examples/` directory contains small scripts demonstrating how to log images from the camera. Refer to the configuration files in `config/` to customize the sensor settings.
